     Required by:
         project :
      > The consumer was configured to find a library for use during runtime, compatible with Java 11, packaged as a jar, preferably optimized for standard JVMs, and its dependencies declared externally, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.native.operatingSystem' with value 'windows'. However we cannot choose between the following variants of org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.2.3:
          - natives-windows-runtime
          - natives-windows-x86-runtime
        All of them match the consumer attributes:
          - Variant 'natives-windows-runtime' capability org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.2.3 declares a library for use during runtime, packaged as a jar, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.native.operatingSystem' with value 'windows':
              - Unmatched attributes:
                  - Doesn't say anything about how its dependencies are found (required its dependencies declared externally)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java version (required compatibility with Java 11)
                  - Provides attribute 'org.gradle.native.architecture' with value 'x86-64' but the consumer didn't ask for it
                  - Provides release status but the consumer didn't ask for it
          - Variant 'natives-windows-x86-runtime' capability org.lwjgl:lwjgl:3.2.3 declares a library for use during runtime, packaged as a jar, as well as attribute 'org.gradle.native.operatingSystem' with value 'windows':
              - Unmatched attributes:
                  - Doesn't say anything about how its dependencies are found (required its dependencies declared externally)
                  - Doesn't say anything about its target Java environment (preferred optimized for standard JVMs)
